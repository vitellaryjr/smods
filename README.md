# Steamodded - A Balatro Modding Framework

## Introduction

Steamodded is a mod loader and injector for the game Balatro. Much like the [LÃ–VE framework](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) itself, it is built using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It is made with modularity and extensibility in mind, providing a large selection of APIs and other features to facilitate bringing your ideas to life.
